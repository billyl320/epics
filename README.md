# EPICS
Extracting Physical-Characteristics from Images of Chromatin Structures (EPICS) is a machine-learning based computational method for processing high-resolution chromatin 3D image data. 

Each of the experiments associated with EPICS is provided in respective branches.  Specifically, experiments were done on 3D-EMISH and 3D-SIM data.  Those experiments (code, associated data, and output) are all provided in their respective branches.
